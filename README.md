# CodSoft Internship Projects
This repository showcases the projects I developed during my CodSoft internship from June 20th to July 20th. These projects highlight my learning journey and contributions.

## Project 1: Titanic survival prediction model using Python
- *Description*: Developed a Titanic survival prediction model using Python on Google Colab. Leveraged libraries such as Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation and analysis, and Scikit-learn for building and evaluating the machine learning model. The project involved extensive data preprocessing, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling. A logistic regression model was trained to predict the survival of passengers based on features like age, gender, passenger class, and fare. The model's performance was evaluated using accuracy, precision, and recall metrics, providing insights into the factors influencing survival rates on the Titanic.
- *Technologies*: Pandas ,NumPy and Scikit-learn
- *Features*:
  - age
  - gender
  - passenger class
  - fare
- *Outcome*:  A logistic regression model was trained to predict the survival of passengers based on features like age, gender, passenger class, and fare. The model's performance was evaluated using accuracy, precision, and recall metrics, providing insights into the factors influencing survival rates on the Titanic.

## Project 2: Movie Rating Prediction model using Python
- *Description*: Developed a movie rating prediction model using Python on Google Colab. Leveraged Pandas and NumPy for data preprocessing, handling missing values, and normalizing data. Used Scikit-learn to build and evaluate a collaborative filtering model. Key features included user ID, movie ID, and historical ratings. The model was trained to predict user ratings for unseen movies based on past preferences and similar user behaviors. Performance was evaluated using RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error), achieving a satisfactory level of accuracy. 
- *Technologies*: Pandas ,NumPy and Scikit-learn
- *Features*:
  - user ID
  - movie ID
  - historical ratings
- *Outcome*: This project demonstrated the application of machine learning in personalized recommendations, providing valuable insights into user preferences and improving recommendation systems.

## Project 3: Credit Card Fraud Detection Model
- *Description*: Developed a credit card fraud detection model using Python on Google Colab. Utilized Pandas and NumPy for data preprocessing, addressing class imbalance, and normalizing features. Employed Scikit-learn to build and evaluate a logistic regression model. Key features included transaction amount, transaction time, and user account age. The model was trained to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate. This project demonstrated the potential of machine learning in enhancing security measures and preventing financial fraud in real-time transactions.
- *Technologies*: Pandas and NumPy
- *Features*:
  - transaction amount
  - transaction time
  - user account age
- *Outcome*: The model was trained to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate. Achieved an accuracy of 95% and an F1-score of 0.92, effectively identifying fraudulent activities.
